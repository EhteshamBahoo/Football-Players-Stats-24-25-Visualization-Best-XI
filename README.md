Football Players Stats(2024-2025) Visualization &amp; Best XI Data Analysis Project

# ‚öΩ Football Player Stats Analysis & National Team Simulation

This project analyzes football player statistics for the 2024-2025 season, visualizes top performers, and simulates matches between national teams based on player performance metrics. The analysis and simulations are carried out through three Jupyter Notebooks: `Player-Stats.ipynb`, `National-Team-Stats.ipynb`, and `National-Team-Match-Simulation.ipynb`.

## üìä Overview

### üßë‚Äçüíº Player Stats Analysis
In this notebook, we explore and analyze football player data, including various performance metrics such as goals, assists, and defensive stats. The key steps involved:

- **Data Transformation**: Clean and process the dataset for analysis.
- **Top Scorers & Assisters**: Identify the top goal scorers and top assisters.
- **Best Defenders**: Determine the top defenders based on defensive performance metrics.
- **Best XI**: Visualize the best starting XI based on overall player ratings and performance (represented in a formation chart).

### üåç National Team Stats
Using the player stats, we evaluate the best national teams by aggregating individual player performances. The analysis includes:

- **Top Teams by Performance**: Calculate the best national teams based on player statistics.
- **Top Players from Each Team**: Select the best forwards, midfielders, and defenders from the top 6 performing national teams.

### ‚öîÔ∏è National Team Match Simulation
We used the best players from the top 6 national teams to simulate matches. Key features of the simulation include:

- **Best XI Selection**: For each of the top 6 nations, select the best starting XI based on player stats.
- **Simulation Model**: Use a variety of football performance metrics to simulate realistic match outcomes between these teams.
- **Match Analysis**: Provide detailed analysis of each simulation result.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and simulations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization, including charts and formation diagrams.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: To organize the analysis, visualizations, and simulations.
- **scikit-learn**: For any machine learning or statistical models used in simulations (if applicable).

## üìö Datasets
This project uses the following dataset:
- **Football Player Stats (2024-2025)** by Hubert Sidorowicz: [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hubertsidorowicz/football-players-stats-2024-2025)

## üìà Key Visualizations
- **Best XI in Formation**: A visual representation of the best XI players selected for a 2-3-5 formation.
- **Top Players**: Charts showcasing the top goal scorers, assisters, and defenders.
- **Best National Teams**: A comparative analysis of the top performing national teams based on player stats.
